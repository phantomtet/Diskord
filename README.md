Hello, <br/>
Welcome to my Github page, this is a Discord-look-alike app that used the MERN stack. This is a real-time app, to test, you need to create at least 2 accounts and add friends to each other.
When using the app, you might see the delay, because of the hosting location. Sorry for inconvenience.
- Some logic that is already had in the app:
  + Login, register
  + Add friends, remove friends
  + Inbox, group chat system with file upload, download, notification
  + Update profile (avatar, username)
- Upcoming logic:
  + ....
